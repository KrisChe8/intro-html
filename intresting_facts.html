                <p> are often called the "terrestrial planets" because their surfaces are rocky. Pluto also has a rocky, albeit frozen, surface but has never been grouped with the four terrestrials.</p>

               <p> are sometimes called the Jovian or "Jupiter-like" planets because of their enormous size relative to the terrestrial planets. They're also mostly made of gases like hydrogen, helium and ammonia rather than of rocky surfaces, although astronomers believe some or all of them may have solid cores.  </p>

        <section class="sun">
            <h3>The Sun</h3>
            <p>The sun is by far the largest object in our solar system, containing 99.8% of the solar system's mass. It sheds most of the heat and light that makes life possible on Earth and possibly elsewhere. Planets orbit the sun in oval-shaped paths called ellipses, with the sun slightly off-center of each ellipse. </p>

        <section class="asteroids">
            <h3>The asteroid belt</h3>
            <p>Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt. Asteroids are minor planets, and according to NASA there are approximately between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids in the main asteroid belt larger than 0.6 miles (1 km) in diameter and millions more smaller asteroids. 

                The dwarf planet Ceres, about 590 miles (950 km) in diameter, resides here. A number of asteroids have orbits that take them closer into the solar system that sometimes lead them to collide with Earth or the other inner planets. </p>

        <section class="planetNine">
            <h3>Planet Nine</h3>
            <p>In 2016, researchers proposed the possible existence of a ninth planet, for now, dubbed "Planet Nine" or Planet X. The planet is estimated to be about 10 times the mass of Earth and to orbit the sun between 300 and 1,000 times farther than the orbit of the Earth. </p>
            <p>Scientists have not seen Planet Nine. They inferred its existence by its gravitational effects on other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region at the fringe of the solar system that is home to icy rocks left over from the birth of the solar system. Also called trans-Neptunian objects, these Kuiper Belt objects have highly elliptical or oval orbits that align in the same direction.  </p>
